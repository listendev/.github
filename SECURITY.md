As a security company, security is our priority.

We at [listen.dev](https://listen.dev) take the security of our software products and services seriously, including the open source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as the [listendev](https://github.com/listendev) organization.

Long story short, if you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our repositories, you can report it to us in one of two ways:

- Report it to us by using the private vulnerability reporting (`https://github.com/listendev/<repo>/security/advisories`) feature of the specific repository.

  - Such reports are not eligible for a bounty reward.

- Submit the report by sending an email to [security@listen.dev](mailto:security@listen.dev).

:point_right: **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

:point_right: We strongly **advice** you to read our [disclosure policy](https://listen.dev/security/disclosure/) before proceeding.

Thanks for helping make **listen.dev tools safer for everyone**.
