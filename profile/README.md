### 🐬 About listen.dev

As modern software gets built on open source foundations and the ecosystem continues to expand, ensuring its security, reliability, and trustworthiness presents major challenges. 

Behind listen.dev is a tribe of builders, problem solvers and OSS maintainers. Our firsthand experiences as everyday consumers, maintainers, and leaders of industry-standard open-source projects fuel our mission to make the world's open source more secure and reliable.

### We ❤️ OSS

Open source is built into the DNA of listen.dev. As we stand on the shoulders of giants, we like to give back to the community and also maintain a bunch of projects ourselves. Most of our projects are open to the public, and we are always looking for contributors to help us build the future of open source security.
